# Day 10 of My 3 Weeks Game Challenge

This is my tenth day of my [3 weeks challenge](https://github.com/zsoltime/game-challenge) with a Rock Paper Scissors game written in vanilla JS.

The rules are simple; rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock.

## User Stories

- [x] As a user, I can see the three choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- [x] I can choose one of them
- [x] Once I chose an option, the computer also picks one randomly
- [ ] Once the computer picked one, a winner is declared

## Next Steps
